# Hello, World!

I'm **tandukuda**, a graphic designer and 3D artist who creates visuals with intent—clear, structured, and expressive, whether static or in motion. My work sits at the intersection of design, motion, and systems, driven by an obsession with structure, mood, and efficiency. Whether it's brand visuals, 3D scenes, or motion work, I care less about trends and more about making things feel deliberate and functional.
