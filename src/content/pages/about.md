# About

**Monograph** is a minimalist, editorial index-style portfolio built with [Astro](https://astro.build).

It is designed to be readable, durable, and resistant to trend decay. It features a strict three-column layout, file-based content management, and zero-runtime JavaScript (except where strictly necessary for **Search**).
